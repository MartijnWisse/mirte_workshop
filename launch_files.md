# Launch files
Launch files are ideal to start multiple ROS nodes at once. Launch files can include other launch files.

## 1. Command-line launch commands
The `roslaunch` command cleverly checks whether ROS is already running. You have already seen this because you used the launch command twice:  
```console
roslaunch mirte_workshop mirte_workshop.launch
```
started the basic nodes for driving control etc.  
```console
roslaunch mirte_teleop teleopkey.launch
```
started the node that allowed keyboard control for driving.

The command structure is `roslaunch <package_name> <file_name>`. It cleverly knows to find the package folder and to check in the `launch` folder inside that package folder. Verify the above commands with the folder structure on the left side of the VS Code screen.

## 2. Create your own launch file
In the folder `~/mirte_ws/src/mirte_workshop/launch`, create a new file and call it `arm_and_gripper.launch`.  
Copy the following code into it:

```xml
<launch>
    <node pkg="mirte_workshop" name="arm_server" type="arm_server.py" output="screen"/>
</launch>
```

Save the file and test it with
```console
roslaunch mirte_workshop arm_and_gripper.launch
```  
Now add the `gripper_server.py` node to the launch file and test it.
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that nodes are not started twice. Other team members may start nodes from their computer.  

## 3. `roslaunch` trumps `rosrun`
`roslaunch` is at the top of the food chain. It is the most complete and robust way to launch nodes. It is better than the quick command that your team members use:  
```console
rosrun mirte_workshop arm_server.py
```
so it is advisable to make nice launch files for them.

By the way, the `rosrun` command is still better than
```console
python3 arm_server.py
```
For `rosrun` and `roslaunch` to work, you must tell Linux that your Python files are executable:  
```console
chmod +x python_file_name.py
``` 

## 4. Include other launch files
Code that works well, does not need to be started separately; you can have it launch together with all the other nodes. Just leave your new `arm_and_gripper.launch` file as it is, and add the following line to `mirte_workshop.launch`

```xml
<include file="$(find mirte_workshop)/launch/arm_and_gripper.launch"/>
```

Or, vice versa, you could include the `mirte_workshop.launch` file in your own.

## 5. Alias
For an even faster start, you can create an 'alias' in Linux. 
Open the file `~/.bashrc` in the editor. Add the following line at the bottom of the file:  

```console
alias go='roslaunch mirte_workshop mirte_workshop.launch'
```

Save the file. All **new** terminals will now execute the `roslaunch` command if you type
```console
go
```
but existing terminals won't, unless you first
```console
source ~/.bashrc
``` 

## 6. Create an integrated system
Discuss with your team members which files need to be started automatically. Some, like keyboard control, are better started separately in their own terminal. Create your complete application!

It is advised to analyze the `mirte_workshop.launch` file thoroughly, and request explanation from ChatGPT about any unclear code in that file. It is nice to check the content of the launch file with
```console
rosnode list
```
